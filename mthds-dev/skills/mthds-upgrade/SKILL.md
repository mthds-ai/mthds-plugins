# Upgrade MTHDS CLI tools

Upgrade mthds-agent and its managed tools to the latest versions.

## Process

### Step 0 — Environment Check (mandatory, do this FIRST)

Run this command to check toolchain status:

```bash
# Pick the cached env-check from the plugin version with the highest semver.
# Matches both `mthds` (prod) and `mthds-dev` (dev) plugin caches. The padded
# segment trick keeps lex order = semver order so 0.10 doesn't sort below 0.9.
_best_f=""; _best_k=""
for f in "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/"*/mthds*/*/bin/mthds-env-check; do
  [ -x "$f" ] || continue
  _v="${f%/bin/*}"; _v="${_v##*/}"
  _k=""; IFS=. read -ra _parts <<<"${_v%%[-+]*}"
  for _p in "${_parts[@]}"; do _p=${_p%%[!0-9]*}; _k="${_k}$(printf '%06d' "${_p:-0}")"; done
  [[ "$_k" > "$_best_k" ]] && { _best_f="$f"; _best_k="$_k"; }
done
[ -n "$_best_f" ] && exec "$_best_f" "0.7.0"
echo "MTHDS_ENV_CHECK_MISSING"
```

**Interpret the output:**

- `MTHDS_AGENT_MISSING` → STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> The `mthds-agent` CLI is required but not installed. Install it with:
>
> ```
> rm -rf /tmp/mthds-js-build /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && mkdir -p /tmp/mthds-js-build && tar -C /build-src/mthds-js --exclude=./.git -cf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar . && tar -C /tmp/mthds-js-build -xf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && rm -f /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && npm install -g /tmp/mthds-js-build/
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- `MTHDS_AGENT_VERSION_UNKNOWN` → STOP. The installed `mthds-agent` returned an unparseable version. Tell the user:

> Could not parse the output of `mthds-agent --version`. Your installation may be corrupt. Reinstall with:
>
> ```
> rm -rf /tmp/mthds-js-build /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && mkdir -p /tmp/mthds-js-build && tar -C /build-src/mthds-js --exclude=./.git -cf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar . && tar -C /tmp/mthds-js-build -xf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && rm -f /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && npm install -g /tmp/mthds-js-build/
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- `MTHDS_AGENT_OUTDATED <installed> <required>` → The installed `mthds-agent` is too old for this plugin. **Do not hard-stop.** Instead, tell the user their mthds-agent (v\<installed>) is older than the required v\<required>, then follow the [upgrade flow](../shared/upgrade-flow.md) to offer upgrading mthds-agent via `rm -rf /tmp/mthds-js-build /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && mkdir -p /tmp/mthds-js-build && tar -C /build-src/mthds-js --exclude=./.git -cf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar . && tar -C /tmp/mthds-js-build -xf /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && rm -f /tmp/mthds-js-build.tar && npm install -g /tmp/mthds-js-build/`. After the upgrade flow completes (whether the user upgraded or declined), proceed to Step 1. The upgrade flow's "Not now" and "Never ask" options let users continue with current versions.

- `MTHDS_UPDATE_CHECK_FAILED ...` → WARN. The update check command failed. Show the error output to the user. Suggest checking network connectivity and `mthds-agent` installation. Proceed to Step 1 with current versions.

- `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE ...` → Read [upgrade flow](../shared/upgrade-flow.md) and follow the upgrade prompts before continuing to Step 1.

- `JUST_UPGRADED ...` → Announce what was upgraded to the user, then continue to Step 1.

- `MTHDS_ENV_CHECK_MISSING` → WARN. The env-check script was not found at either expected path. Tell the user the environment check could not run, but proceed to Step 1.



- No output or `UP_TO_DATE` → Proceed to Step 1.

- Any other output → WARN. The preamble produced unexpected output. Show it to the user verbatim. Proceed to Step 1 cautiously.


### Step 1: Force Version Check

```bash
mthds-agent update-check --force
```

Interpret the output:
- No output or `UP_TO_DATE`: All tools are up to date. Tell the user and stop.
- `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <json>`: Upgrades are available. Read `../shared/upgrade-flow.md` and follow the upgrade flow.
- `JUST_UPGRADED <json>`: Tools were just upgraded. Report what changed and stop.
- `MTHDS_AGENT_OUTDATED <installed> <required>`: mthds-agent itself is outdated. Warn the user that their mthds-agent (v\<installed>) is older than v\<required> and suggest `npm install -g mthds@latest`, but do not block — proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Report Summary

After upgrade completes (or if already up to date), summarize:
- Which tools were checked
- Which were upgraded (with old -> new versions)
- Which failed (with manual install commands)
- Current status of all tools
