# Install MTHDS method packages

Install method packages from GitHub or local directories using the `mthds-agent` CLI.

## Process

### Step 0 — Environment Check (mandatory, do this FIRST)

Run this command to check toolchain status:

```bash
# Wrapped in `bash -c` so the bash array syntax below works even when the
# session shell is zsh (Codex runs blocks under the user's shell).
bash -c '
# Pick the cached env-check from the plugin version with the highest semver.
# Pad each numeric segment to fixed width so lex sort matches semver sort
# (avoids the 0.10 < 0.9 lex-order trap). Sort keys are digits-only by
# construction, so the [[ > ]] compare is locale-independent. Bash 3.2 OK.
_best_f=""; _best_k=""
for f in "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"/plugins/cache/*/mthds/*/bin/mthds-env-check; do
  [ -x "$f" ] || continue
  _v="${f%/bin/*}"; _v="${_v##*/}"
  _k=""; IFS=. read -ra _parts <<<"${_v%%[-+]*}"
  for _p in "${_parts[@]}"; do _p=${_p%%[!0-9]*}; _k="${_k}$(printf %06d "${_p:-0}")"; done
  [[ "$_k" > "$_best_k" ]] && { _best_f="$f"; _best_k="$_k"; }
done
[ -n "$_best_f" ] && exec "$_best_f" "0.8.1" --codex
echo "MTHDS_ENV_CHECK_MISSING"
'
```

**Interpret the output:**

- `MTHDS_AGENT_MISSING` → STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> The `mthds-agent` CLI is required but not installed. Install it with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- `MTHDS_AGENT_VERSION_UNKNOWN` → STOP. The installed `mthds-agent` returned an unparseable version. Tell the user:

> Could not parse the output of `mthds-agent --version`. Your installation may be corrupt. Reinstall with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds@latest
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- `MTHDS_AGENT_OUTDATED <installed> <required>` → The installed `mthds-agent` is too old for this plugin. **Do not hard-stop.** Instead, tell the user their mthds-agent (v\<installed>) is older than the required v\<required>, then follow the [upgrade flow](../shared/upgrade-flow.md) to offer upgrading mthds-agent via `npm install -g mthds@latest`. After the upgrade flow completes (whether the user upgraded or declined), proceed to Step 1. The upgrade flow's "Not now" and "Never ask" options let users continue with current versions.

- `MTHDS_UPDATE_CHECK_FAILED ...` → WARN. The update check command failed. Show the error output to the user. Suggest checking network connectivity and `mthds-agent` installation. Proceed to Step 1 with current versions.

- `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE ...` → Read [upgrade flow](../shared/upgrade-flow.md) and follow the upgrade prompts before continuing to Step 1.

- `JUST_UPGRADED ...` → Announce what was upgraded to the user, then continue to Step 1.

- `MTHDS_ENV_CHECK_MISSING` → WARN. The env-check script was not found at either expected path. Tell the user the environment check could not run, but proceed to Step 1.

- `CODEX_CONFIG_NEEDS_SETUP` → Codex's `~/.codex/` is not set up for the mthds plugin, so the bundled `.mthds` validation hook will not load. The env-check may print a `#`-prefixed diagnostic line after the status — relay it if present. Resolve this before Step 1:

  1. **Preview** — run `mthds-agent codex apply-config --dry-run` and show the user the output. `WOULD_APPLY` lists the keys it will add under `applied`; `ALREADY_OK` means no keys need adding. Either way, relay any `warnings` entries — those (e.g. read-only sandbox, hooks disabled) need a hand-fix `apply-config` will not perform. If `ALREADY_OK` with no warnings, treat as resolved and go to Step 1.
  2. **Ask** — use AskUserQuestion: "Apply Codex config now?" with options "Apply now" / "Skip".
  3. **Apply now** — run `mthds-agent codex apply-config`:
     - `APPLIED` / `ALREADY_OK` → tell the user the config is fixed and they must **restart Codex** for the validation hook to load (it will not load in this session). Relay any `warnings` — those still need a hand-fix.
     - Error about conflicting keys → show it verbatim; the user must hand-edit `~/.codex/config.toml`, then re-run `mthds-agent codex apply-config`.
     - Error from the sandbox blocking the write to `~/.codex/config.toml` → ask the user to run `mthds-agent codex apply-config` themselves in a terminal, then restart Codex.
  4. **Skip** — tell the user the validation hook stays off until they run `mthds-agent codex apply-config` and restart Codex.

  Then proceed to Step 1. This session has no PostToolUse hook. The mthds skills still run `mthds-agent validate bundle` explicitly, so `.mthds` files built or edited through a skill are still semantically validated — but the write-time `plxt lint`/`fmt` pass depends on the hook and will not run until Codex is restarted.

- No output or `UP_TO_DATE` → Proceed to Step 1.

- Any other output → WARN. The preamble produced unexpected output. Show it to the user verbatim. Proceed to Step 1 cautiously.


Do not attempt manual installation. The CLI handles resolution, file placement, shim generation, and runtime setup.

> **No backend setup needed**: This skill works without configuring inference backends or API keys. You can start building/validating methods right away. Backend configuration is only needed to run methods with live inference — use `/mthds-runner-setup` when you're ready.

### Step 1: Identify the Source

Determine where the method package lives:

| Source | Syntax | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| GitHub (short) | `org/repo` | `mthds-ai/contract-analysis` |
| GitHub (full URL) | `https://github.com/org/repo` | `https://github.com/mthds-ai/contract-analysis` |
| Local directory | `--local <path>` | `--local ./my-methods/` |

If the user provides a GitHub URL or `org/repo` string, use it as the address argument. If they point to a local directory, use `--local`.

### Step 2: Choose Install Parameters

| Flag | Required | Values | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `--location` | Yes | `local`, `global` | `local` = project `.mthds/methods/`, `global` = `~/.mthds/methods/` |
| `--method <name>` | No | method name | Install only one method from a multi-method package |
| `--no-runner` | No | — | Skip automatic Pipelex runtime installation |

Method packages always install under `.mthds/methods/` regardless of which agent runs the command.

**Defaults**:
- Use `--location local` unless the user explicitly asks for global install

### Step 3: Run the Install

**From GitHub**:

```bash
mthds-agent install <org/repo> --location local
```

**From a local directory**:

```bash
mthds-agent install --local <path> --location local
```

**Install a specific method from a multi-method package**:

```bash
mthds-agent install <org/repo> --location local --method <name>
```

### Step 4: Present Results

On success, the CLI returns JSON:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "installed_methods": ["method-name"],
  "location": "local",
  "target_dir": "/path/to/.mthds/methods",
  "shim_dir": "~/.mthds/bin",
  "shims_generated": ["method-name"]
}
```

Present to the user:
- Which methods were installed and where (`target_dir`)
- If CLI shims were generated, note the shim directory and advise adding `~/.mthds/bin` to PATH if not already present

### Step 5: Handle Errors

Common errors:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--location is required` | Missing `--location` flag | Add `--location local` or `--location global` |
| `Failed to resolve methods` | GitHub repo not found or no methods in repo | Verify the address and that the repo contains METHODS.toml |
| `Method "X" not found` | `--method` filter doesn't match any method in the package | Check available method names in the package |
| `Failed to install pipelex runtime` | Runtime install failed (network, permissions) | Retry, or use `--no-runner` to skip runtime install |
